This is the basis of my level for my final project. This is a semi open design, there is a open level that is walled off to prevent players from falling off the edges, It will also be used to create tunnel assets for the roads. I am aiming for an abandoned city vibe. This is focused around city park with an overpass there is a diner, there is some damaged buildings, one building has fallen over blocking the street. I have the main boxes laid out and I started one some of the more complex models like the overpass. I need to design clutter and debris to help fell in the areas, as well has just models in general, I also need to start collecting textures.
